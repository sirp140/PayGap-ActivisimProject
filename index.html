      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p id="aboutPara"> The gender pay gap refers to the disparity in earnings between men and women in the workplace. Despite progress in recent years, women still earn less than men on average for the same work. The gender pay gap is a complex issue that can have long-term effects on women's financial security and career advancement. Addressing this gap requires a collective effort from employers, policymakers, and individuals to ensure that everyone is paid fairly and equally, regardless of gender.</p>

This not only affects women's ability to support themselves and their families financially.
